# Older GPUs (experimental)

Strata's supported cards are NVIDIA RTX 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 and the AMD cards in [AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md). The cards
below run through **opt-in, experimental** paths that community members wrote and measured on their own machines. The
maintainers have none of these cards: each path is compile-checked and unit-tested here, and the ready-made engines
and their output stay exactly as they were. Numbers are the reporters' own, on one machine each.

## Support matrix

### NVIDIA

| Cards | Compute capability | How it runs | What is different on it | Reported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tesla P100 | 6.0 | the CUDA 12 engine | `__dp4a` emulated (bit-exact); BF16 projections through fp32; opt-in: `STRATA_Q8_SM60=1` runs the Q8_0 dense projections and head on a GP100 kernel ([below](#pascal-gp100-a-q8_0-decode-kernel-opt-in)) | PH402 (4 GP100 dies), IQ3_XXS: decode 28.3 -> 38.9 tok/s with `STRATA_Q8_SM60=1` and a Q8_0 dense shard |
| Tesla P40 / P4, GTX 10 series | 6.1 | the CUDA 12 engine | BF16 projections through fp32 (cuBLAS has no BF16 GEMM there, #395) | P40, IQ3_S, engine 0.1.30: prompt 217-374 tok/s, decode 30-33 tok/s (#395) |
| Tesla V100, Titan V | 7.0 | the CUDA 12 engine | BF16 projections on the FP16 tensor cores (#655, #540); the prompt attention on `mma.m8n8k4` (#600); a leaner attention kernel (#540) | V100-PCIE-32GB, UD-IQ4_XS: prompt 1,123-1,251 tok/s (#600); V100 32GB, IQ2_XS: prompt +22% from #540 |
| RTX 20 (Turing) | 7.5 | **supported**, the ready-made engine | opt-in: `STRATA_BF16_TC=1` runs the BF16 projections on the FP16 tensor cores | RTX 2080 Ti, Q2_0: prompt +15-18% (#655) |

A card needs enough VRAM to be useful: 12 GB or more is recommended, as for every card (a 2 GB GT 1030 is compute
capability 6.1 too, and cannot hold any of the model).

### AMD

| Cards | Architecture | How it runs | Reported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RX 6800 / 6900 series | gfx1030 | setup (`--backend hip`), unvalidated; #540's attention kernel is the default there, with 8 cells per step and DPP lane exchanges (bit-exact; `STRATA_ATTN_PRE75=0` runs the standard kernel) | [AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md#rdna2-gfx1030); RX 6900 XT, IQ3_S: prompts +4-6% alone, +7-12% with #835 ([bench/results/2026-10-04-rdna2-pre75-attention](../bench/results/2026-10-04-rdna2-pre75-attention/README.md)) |
| RX 6700 XT | gfx1031 | setup (`--backend hip`), unvalidated (#524) | used daily by its reporter, one card |
| RX 5500 XT (RDNA1) | gfx1012 | built by hand: `-DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1012` (HIP 5.7 or 7) | 8 GB card, IQ3_S, 8K prompt: 15.3 tok/s decode (#442) |
| RX 5700 XT (RDNA1) | gfx1010 | built by hand: `-DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1010`, on ROCm 7.14's `gfx101X-dgpu` wheels; needs `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` in a PC that also has an AMD iGPU | 8 GB card, Coder IQ1_M, 32K context: prompt 115 / 144 / 149 tok/s and decode 18.0 / 20.3 / 23.3 tok/s at 4K / 16K / 30K prompt tokens, 6 of 6 needle checks at 8K and 30K, 61 of 61 ctest on the card, 607 of 12,288 experts in VRAM |
| RX 5700 and the 6 GB RX 5600 (RDNA1) | gfx1010 | as above | the same Navi 10 silicon as the RX 5700 XT, so the same build; a 6 GB card leaves ~50 expert slots, expect the RX 5500 XT's range, not this one's |
| Radeon PRO V520 / Pro 5600M (RDNA1) | gfx1011 | built by hand: `-DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1011` | untested on hardware: it is the same RDNA1 ISA as gfx1010 (Navi 12), and the engine builds for it with 0 errors on the same wheels |
| Instinct MI50 / MI60, Radeon VII | gfx906 (wave64) | built by hand: `-DSTRATA_HIP_GFX906=ON` | 2x MI50, Coder IQ1_M, 128K context: decode 50.1 / 47.8 / 45.7 tok/s at 4K / 32K / 128K prompt tokens, prompt ~520 tok/s (#677) |

## NVIDIA: the CUDA 12 engine

CUDA 13 dropped Pascal and Volta: it cannot compile for them. Setup therefore keeps a **second engine**, built with
CUDA 12.9 and `-DSTRATA_EXPERIMENTAL_SM60=ON`, in its own folder (`engine-cuda12\`, beside `engine\`). One engine runs
per model, so the choice is made per model, by the oldest card that model runs on:

- **Every card the model uses is RTX 20 or newer:** the ready-made CUDA 13 engine, as always.
- **A card is Pascal or Volta:** the CUDA 12 engine. Setup says so (`CUDA 12: sm_70 is older than CUDA 13 supports
  ...`). On Windows it downloads `strata-windows-x64-cuda12.zip` with NVIDIA's CUDA 12 libraries (from pip, like the
  CUDA 13 ones); on Linux, or with `--build`, it compiles the engine with a CUDA 12.x toolkit.

### Opting in

An older card is used only when you choose it; a PC with a newer card keeps recommending the newer one.

| You | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| have only Pascal / Volta NVIDIA cards (and no AMD card it can use) | uses them, with the CUDA 12 engine |
| name the card: `START-HERE.bat --setup --gpu 1`, or `--gpus 0,1` with a newer card | uses it; the model gets the CUDA 12 engine |
| `--cuda 12` (or `STRATA_CUDA=12`) | the CUDA 12 engine for this model, on any card |
| `--cuda 13` | the CUDA 13 engine even with an older card (a warning: it has no code for that card) |
| `STRATA_EXPERIMENTAL_SM60=1` | the older cards are listed as usable (the setting from #295 still works) |

The choice is kept in the model's config (`"cuda": 12`): its starts and `UPDATE.bat` keep it, and other models keep
their own engine. Setting the model up again chooses again (by its cards; add `--cuda 12` to keep a forced choice). A Pascal / Volta card added to a model at a start (`--gpus`) moves that model to the
CUDA 12 engine.

`--cuda 12` is also the way to run Strata with an NVIDIA driver older than 580: CUDA 12 needs 528 or newer on Windows
(527.41, NVIDIA's minor-version compatibility) and 525 on Linux; setup's "driver too old" stop says so. Such old
drivers were not tested here.

### Mixed cards

A model that shares a V100 with an RTX 30 / 40 card runs both on the CUDA 12 engine (it has code for sm_60 to sm_89,
plus PTX). An RTX 50 card (sm_120) in a CUDA 12 engine is a warning, not a stop: CUDA 12.8 and newer compile for it,
but engines built with 12.8 crashed on long prompts there (#220, #224). Keep the RTX 50 card on its own model (`--gpu
N`), where it runs the CUDA 13 engine.

### Building it yourself

```sh
# Linux (Windows: the same with the toolkit's nvcc.exe)
cmake -S . -B build-cuda12 -DSTRATA_ENABLE_CUDA=ON -DSTRATA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DSTRATA_EXPERIMENTAL_SM60=ON \
      -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="61;70" -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda-12.9/bin/nvcc
cmake --build build-cuda12 --target strata -j
```

Setup does the same when it compiles: it looks for the newest CUDA 12.x toolkit (`STRATA_NVCC=<path to nvcc>` picks
one, #601; on glibc 2.43 use 12.8, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)).

On GCC 12.3 with nvcc (openEuler 24.03, CUDA 12.8, 2x V100) the build needed `-D_BITS_OPT_RANDOM_H` added to the host flags (#1074; one
report, not reproduced here). The `size_t` error in `vmm.hpp` that the same report hit is fixed in 0.1.40.2.

### What the flag changes, and what it does not

`-DSTRATA_EXPERIMENTAL_SM60=ON` lowers the runtime floor to compute capability 6.0 and compiles the older cards' code
paths into that build only: the Volta prompt attention (#600), #540's attention kernel (used below sm_75), and the
Pascal BF16 path. The ready-made CUDA 13 engine has none of them, so its kernels and its output are unchanged. The
FP16 path for BF16 projections is in every build but runs by default only below sm_75; RTX 20 owners can try it with
`STRATA_BF16_TC=1` (`=0` turns it off on a V100). It is not bitwise the same as cuBLAS's BF16 kernel (FP16 tensor-core
sums round differently): #540 measured a mean KL of 8.4e-3 on the next-token distribution of 24 code prompts on a V100
(the same top-1 in 23), the size of other summation-order changes; #655 a worst relative difference of 3.5e-5 per
product on an RTX 2080 Ti.

### Pascal GP100: a Q8_0 decode kernel (opt-in)

GP100 (P100, PH402) is the one Pascal chip without `__dp4a`, and the decode kernels are written for the cards that have
it: on a GP100 die the dense projections of a verify window read their weights at 40-80 GB/s of its ~730, decoding K-
and i-quant blocks (Q6_K, IQ4_XS, Q4_K, IQ3_S, ...) one int at a time. Two changes, both measured on a PH402 only:

- **`STRATA_Q8_SM60=1`** packs every Q8_0 dense matrix and the head into the planes of `STRATA_Q8_PACKED` (any shape)
  and runs them on `src/kernels/cuda/q8_sm60.cuh`: a warp (half or quarter warp for narrow rows) per row, 16-byte
  weight loads, the window's q8_1 activations copied once per workgroup into shared memory as an int8 plane, the dot
  on `STRATA_DP4A` (vmad), a shuffle sum - no barrier per row. Shapes it declines (a 6144-wide row with 7-8 columns)
  keep the usual kernel. Not bitwise the exact kernels (the per-32 products are added in another order). The packed
  copies cost their size in VRAM beside the GGUF layout the prompt path reads (Flash-Next: 2.9 GiB of dense
  projections over the stages and 0.6 GiB for the head).
- The GSQ-RCO packs have no Q8_0 dense matrices, so the kernel needs a copy of the model whose dense projections and head are
  Q8_0: `python tools/q8_dense_gguf.py <model>-00001-of-00002.gguf <new folder>` writes one: every shard that holds
  such matrices is converted (Swift 1.5 keeps them in both of its shards) and the rest are hard-linked beside them
  (+3.5 GiB; the experts keep their offsets, so the native pack is reused). Point `--native` and
  `--ple-gguf` at the new folder. Requantizing costs at most 0.4% of a tensor's |w|max (Q8_0 is finer than the
  sources).
- IQ3_XXS's codebook and sign-mask tables are staged in shared memory by the grouped expert kernels on compute
  capability 6.x (ported from shinbunbun/llama-cpp-p100-patches 29 and 30; bitwise the same output;
  `STRATA_IQ_STAGE_GRID18=0|1` forces it off or on, on any card). Within noise on the PH402 (+0-4%).

Measured on a PH402 SKU 200 (two boards, four GP100 dies of 48 SMs and 32 GB HBM2), application clocks locked at
1050 MHz, Windows 11, driver 581.80 (TCC), CUDA 12.9, engine 0.1.40.2; Flash-Next IQ3_XXS, 32K, `--layer-split 12,24,36
--prefill 2048`; greedy, 256 tokens, medians of 2-3 interleaved starts, decode tok/s:

| | ~10.7K-token document | the same, cached | short reasoning | code | mean |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| GSQ-RCO shard, exact kernels | 28.8 | 29.4 | 28.4 | 26.8 | 28.3 |
| Q8_0 dense shard, `STRATA_Q8_PACKED=1` | 27.5 | 31.0 | 34.4 | 31.8 | 31.1 |
| Q8_0 dense shard, `STRATA_Q8_SM60=1` | 37.5 | 38.4 | 41.2 | 38.5 | 38.9 |

GPU time per verify window (`STRATA_VERIFY_PROFILE`): dense projections 19.2 -> 11.2 ms, head 4.25 -> 2.1 ms; the
draft policy then picks longer windows (2.10 -> 2.31 tokens per window). Prompt reads are unchanged (437-438 tok/s at
10.7K). `tools/q8_sm60_check.cu` checks the kernel against a CPU reference on these shapes (1-8 columns) and times it.

Two things that mattered as much on this card: its default application clock is 759 MHz, and a layer split leaves
each die idle most of a window, so the dies decode below 1050 MHz unless the clocks are locked
(`nvidia-smi -i <dies> -ac 715,1050` as administrator; 25.0 -> 29.1 tok/s at 10.7K context). And a second engine on
the same PC that pins its threads to the same logical CPUs halves this one's decode while it runs (the host thread
is time-sliced); keeping the two on different logical CPUs (SMT siblings) avoided it.

A/B switches: `STRATA_BF16_TC=0|1`, `STRATA_PROMPT_ATTN_OLD=1` (the decode kernel for prompts), `STRATA_ATTN_PRE75=0`
(#540's kernel off; on gfx103x with HIP that kernel is the default, see the AMD table above, and `=1` turns it on for
another wave32 AMD card). [NVIDIA_V100.md](NVIDIA_V100.md) has the V100 build, its measurements and the parity test.

## AMD: building gfx906 and gfx1012

Setup does not build these; build by hand and run `serve/server.py` with a config, as on any other card.

- **gfx906** (MI50 / MI60 / Radeon VII, wave64): a separate opt-in build, `-DSTRATA_HIP_GFX906=ON
  -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx906` (not `STRATA_ENABLE_HIP`). Current ROCm no longer ships gfx906 libraries; the
  reporter used a community ROCm 7.14 image. Recipe, kernels and measurements: [AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md#gfx906-instinct-mi50--mi60-radeon-vii-wave64-built-from-source).
- **gfx1012** (RX 5500 XT): the wave32 backend, `-DSTRATA_ENABLE_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1012`. HIP 5.7
  (Ubuntu's packages) works: older hipBLAS (0.x) is used through rocBLAS, the legacy HIP names and the missing
  `__syncwarp` are version-gated, and RDNA1's missing signed dot4 uses llama.cpp's SDWA sequence
  (`-DSTRATA_GFX1012_PORTABLE_DOT=ON`: the portable one).

## Reports welcome

These paths stay experimental until more people run them. A report with the card, the driver / ROCm version, the
model and the engine log (`strata-<model>.log`) in an issue helps; [COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md](COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md)
has the format for measurements.
